# Green Stocks Analysis

## Overview of Project
   This project's purpose is to collect data from the entire stock market in the year 2017 and 2018 to determine if the stocks were worth investing in. In addition, use Microsft Excel VBA to refactor a VBA script to reduce the amount of time it takes to run the code. The original VBA script can be found in the Excel Spreadsheet listed as "green_stocks 2 (1).xlsm" in the github repository.


## Results 
In the original VBA script (green_stocks2) it took 0.4960938 seconds to run the stocks for the year 2017. For 2018 it took 0.484375 seconds to run. I used For loops to loop through the rows in the data to find the total daily volume, the starting price and the ending price for the current ticker. 
    The run time for the years 2018 and 2017 were the same. It took 0.1445313 seconds to run. To make the code run faster I did a series of things such as, added "For loops" and "if then" statements. I was able to refactor the code to enhance the speed of the run time. 

## Summary
The purpose of this project was to refactor VBA script to reduce the run time for the code and it was successful. The code ran faster than the orignal code. However, there are some disadvantages to refactoring code. For example, depending on the data size it could be very time consuming. Refactoring data does have it's advantages such as, improving the efficiency of the code, use less memory and make it easier to understand for the future. In this case refactoring the orignal VBA script enhanced the spreadsheet and made it run quicker.
